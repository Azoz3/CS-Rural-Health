# Code Workbooks
A code workbook is the fundamental coding pipeline used by the platform underlying N3C, Palantir's Foundry. Per their [documentation](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/documentation/product/code-workbook/overview):

>Code Workbook is an application that allows users to analyze and transform data using an intuitive graphical interface.

This platform contains facilitates individual code transforms in SQL, Python, and R with an Apache Spark backend. This folder describes the primary code used in this project, including: 

 - [Defining COVID-19 Positivity](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/CS-Rural-Health/tree/main/ordinal-scale/code-workbook/Get-COVID-Positive-Patients)
 - [Cohort Definition and Primary Analyses Presesnted in project](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/CS-Rural-Health/tree/main/ordinal-scale/code-workbook/Summary_table)
 - [Data Robustness Matrix](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/CS-Rural-Health/tree/main/ordinal-scale/code-workbook/Site-Quality-Checks)

## Primary Contributors
A portion of the code used in this project (ECMO, race and gender standardization, mechanical ventilation, and smoking status) involves shared logic used across all N3C project as described in the [N3C Cohort Paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.21249511v3.full-text). Additional coding was done primarily by 
[Maryam Khodaverdi, MS](https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/61365) with help of [Jeremy Harper, MS](https://owlhealthworks.com/) and [Alfred Jerrod Anzalone, MS](https://www.unmc.edu/bmi/current-students/student-bios/anzalone-jerrod-bio.html) for searching proper concepts.
