## Abstract

OBJECTIVE: We sought to modify the W.H.O. COVID-19 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement for use in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a multi-center data enclave, to support studies using EHR data for clinical and translational research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on 2,182,104 patients from 57 health centers across the United States diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 between January 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021 were examined. 

RESULTS: Evolution of weekly ordinal scale scores and predictive capability of the modified OS were demonstrated. Over 28 days, an increasing number of individuals transitioned from hospitalization into both outpatient care and death. The distribution of the OS at each week was a function of when patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. 

DISCUSSION: Although data on outcomes over time are still somewhat sparse, leading to a paucity of evidence on which to base decisions about best treatments and timing, we have nevertheless demonstrated the utility of adapting the W.H.O. OS for use in the setting of EHR data.

CONCLUSIONS: As we move forward with treating COVID-19, the ability to have higher fidelity in predicting outcomes and allocating resources is crucial. The proposed modified scoring system has demonstrated utility and allowed us to leverage the majority of sites contributing data to N3C. Although the modified OS may be expanded to have even greater fidelity in future, the general mechanism shows great promise for evaluating COVID-19 status and should allow for better prediction of staffing, patient census, and resource allocation in real-time while also informing clinical decision making.
