## Abstract

IMPORTANCE: Rural communities are among the most underserved and resource-scarce populations in the United States (US). Yet, there has been limited scientific attention focused on COVID-19 mortality among persons in rural areas of the US. Moreover, unlike urban centers, rural data are rarely centralized, precluding comparability across regions.  

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess hospitalization rates and all-cause mortality among persons with definitive COVID-19 diagnoses, to ultimately provide insights into future research needs.

DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) examines a cohort of 573,018 patients from 27 US hospital systems presenting with COVID-19 between January 2020 and March 2021, of whom 117,897 were hospitalized. A sample of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected persons was identified for comparison.

EXPOSURES: ZIP Code information provided by source hospital systems was classified as urban or urban-adjacent rural or nonurban-adjacent rural through a crosswalk to the USDA Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality and hospital admission were the primary outcomes of the study. Kaplan-Meier analysis and mixed effects logistic regression were used to estimate 30-day survival in hospitalized patients and the association between rurality, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality, controlling for major risk factors associated with rural-urban health discrepancies and differences in health system outcomes.

RESULTS: Differences in patient demographics were noted among rural-urban gradients for age, race, ethnicity, BMI, comorbidity incidence, and calendar time of diagnosis. Rural dwellers had higher rates of hospitalization (23% vs. 19%) and all-cause mortality (16% vs. 11%). After adjusting for demographic and baseline differences, rurality was still highly associated with increased odds of hospitalization and all-cause mortality following hospitalization in both urban-adjacent rural (hospitalization: AOR 1.41, 95% CI, 1.37-1.45; mortality: (AOR 1.62, 95% CI, 1.30-1.49)) and nonurban-adjacent rural (hospitalization: AOR 1.42, 95% CI, 1.35-1.50; mortality: AOR 1.38, 95% CI, 1.22-1.55) compared to urban dwellers. Noteworthy is that similar differences in mortality were noted for persons without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization and all-cause mortality are higher among rural populations when compared to urban populations after adjusting for several factors, including age and comorbidities.
