# Code Workbooks
A code workbook is the fundamental coding pipeline used by the platform underlying N3C, Palantir's Foundry. Per their [documentation](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/documentation/product/code-workbook/overview):

>Code Workbook is an application that allows users to analyze and transform data using an intuitive graphical interface.

This platform contains facilitates individual code transforms in SQL, Python, and R with an Apache Spark backend. This folder describes the primary code used in this project, including: 

 - Defining COVID-19 Positivity: [R](), [Python](), [SQL]()
 - Mapping ZIP Code to Rurality:[R](), [Python](), [SQL]()
 - Cohort Definition and Primary Analyses Presesnted in project: [R](), [Python](), [SQL]()
 - Data Robustness Matrix: [R](), [Python](), [SQL]()

## Primary Contributors
Much of the code used in this project involves shared logic used across all N3C project as described in the [N3C Cohort Paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.21249511v3.full-text). Additional coding was done primarily by 
[Alfred Jerrod Anzalone, MS](https://www.unmc.edu/bmi/current-students/student-bios/anzalone-jerrod-bio.html) with statistical direction and validation done by [Ronald Horswell, PhD](https://lbrn.t-bio.info/our_team/dr-ronald-horswell/) and [San Chu, MS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/san-chu-17a6a359)
